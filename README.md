Documentation
=============

There is no detailed documentation or tutorial, but:

 - the `recipes` folder contains more than 50 working sample scripts,
 - the `scripts` folder contains some useful scripts (like style management),
 - the `doc` folder contains an auto generated documentation.

About styles: the best way to apply style is by merging styles from a template
document into your generated document. See odfdo-style.py in `scripts` folder.
Styles are a complex matter in ODF, so trying to generate styles programmatically
is not recommended.


Limitations
===========

`odfdo` is intended to facilitate the generation of ODF documents,
nevertheless a basic knowledge of the ODF format is necessary.

ODF document rendering can vary greatly from software to software. Especially the
"styles" of the document allow an adaptation of the rendering for a particular
software.

The best (only ?) way to apply style is by merging styles from a template
document into your generated document. See `odfdo-style.py`exempale in the `scripts`
folder.

Changes from former lpod library
================================
`lpod-python` was written in 2009-2010 as a Python 2.x library,
see: https://github.com/lpod/lpod-python

`odfdo` is an adaptation of this formaer project. `odfdo` main changes from `lpod`:

 - `odfdo` requires, at least, Python version >= 3.6 (tested up to python 3.12).
 - API change: more pythonic.
 - include recipes.
 - use Apache 2.0 license.
