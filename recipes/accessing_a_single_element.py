    In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (published in 1984), Arthur
    returns home to Earth, rather surprisingly since it was destroyed when
    he left. He meets and falls in love with a girl named
    [Fenchurch](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minor_characters_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%23Fenchurch), and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the [dolphin](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dolphin)s in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time
    travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read
    the message and feel better about it all before expiring.
